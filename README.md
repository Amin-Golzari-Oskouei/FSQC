# SFQC: Superpixel-based Fast Quantum Clustering for Brain MRI Segmentation

This repository includes the MATLAB implementation of the SFQC algorithm presented in:

A. G. Oskouei, N. Abdolmaleki, and K. Shirini, "SFQC: Superpixel-based Fast Quantum Clustering for Brain MRI Segmentation," (Submitted).

Comments are written for all steps of the algorithm for better understanding the code. Also, a demo is implemented for ease of running, which runs by importing the data and other necessary algorithm parameters.

To evaluate the proposed method, the magnetic resonance images dataset has been used. There are some images of this dataset in the uploaded file (Original and GT files). Whole dataset is available on: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation.
